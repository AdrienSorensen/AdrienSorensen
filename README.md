ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Adrien Sorensen

Iâ€™m a Computer Science student with a passion for AI, embedded systems, and full-stack development. Over the years Iâ€™ve worked on both personal and academic projects ranging from operating system components to production-style web applications.

ðŸ”¹ Strong foundations in Python, C++, C, Java, JavaScript and Scala.

ðŸ”¹ Experienced with Node.js, SQLite, React, and Flutter. 


Most of the projects youâ€™ll find here are **excerpts or selected modules** from larger work.  
Theyâ€™re meant to **showcase my coding style, problem-solving skills, and use of different languages**.  
Iâ€™ve uploaded them recently all at once for convenience, so commit dates may not reflect when they were originally developed.
