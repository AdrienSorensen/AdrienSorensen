ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Adrien Sorensen

Iâ€™m a Computer Science student with a passion for AI, embedded systems, and full-stack development. Over the years Iâ€™ve worked on both personal and academic projects ranging from operating system components to production-style web applications.

ðŸ”¹ Strong foundations in Python, C++, C, Java, JavaScript and Scala.

ðŸ”¹ Experienced with Node.js, SQLite, React, and Flutter. 


Most of the projects youâ€™ll find here are **excerpts or selected modules** from larger work.  
Theyâ€™re meant to **showcase my coding style, problem-solving skills, and use of different languages**.  
Iâ€™ve uploaded them recently all at once for convenience, so commit dates may not reflect when they were originally developed.



ðŸš€ Featured Projects

- **[photos-api-sample](./photos-api-sample)**  
  Minimal RESTful API in Node.js with SQLite, showing routes, validation, and tests.

- **[kvstore-excerpt-c](./kvstore-excerpt-c)**  
  Concurrent key-value store in C with thread pool, bucket mutexes, and rwlocks.

- **[sfs-excerpt-c](./sfs-excerpt-c)**  
  Simple file system in C with path resolution, directory ops, and block table management.

- **[allocator-excerpt-c](./allocator-excerpt-c)**  
  Custom memory allocator in C with free list, split, coalesce, and realloc support.

- **[tetris-scala](./tetris-scala)**  
  Tetris clone implemented in Scala, focusing on functional game logic and modular design.
