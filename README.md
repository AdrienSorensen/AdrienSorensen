👋 Hi, I’m Adrien Sorensen

I’m a Computer Science student with a passion for AI, embedded systems, and full-stack development. Over the years I’ve worked on both personal and academic projects ranging from operating system components to production-style web applications.

🔹 Strong foundations in Python, C, Java, and JavaScript

🔹 Experienced with Node.js, SQLite, React, and Flutter

🔹 Special interest in system programming, concurrency, and applied AI
